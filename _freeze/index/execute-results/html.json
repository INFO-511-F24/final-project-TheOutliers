Through analysis of historical health survey data, we attempt to better understand whether there is a visible trend or relationship between socioeconomic status and leisure-time physical activity in US adults.\n\n## Introduction\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between socioeconomic status and health behaviors is necessary for addressing disparities in public health outcomes. Our project seeks to understand whether higher-income populations consistently have more time for physical activity than lower income populations using a dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The dataset is specifically from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System project and was obtained from phone surveys conducted between 2011 and 2023. The whole dataset offers insights into physical activity, nutrition, and obesity trends among U.S. residents aged 18 and older. For the purpose of this project, we are focusing on the survey questions related to physical activity. The data is stratified by factors such as age, education, gender, income, and race/ethnicity.\n\n## Research Question\n\n**Do higher-income populations have more time for physical activity than lower income populations?**\n\nWe hypothesize that this is true, higher income populations have more time for physical activity. Therefore, populations will engage in more physical activity as their income level increases (positive relationship).\n\n## Data\n\nDataset: [Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity/Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Behavioral/hn4x-zwk7/about_data)\n\nThis dataset is hosted by the United States Center for Disease Control and was obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a CDC project consisting of health-related phone surveys. The original dataset consists of 104,000 rows and 33 columns. Descriptions of all columns are available on the link above. Each row represents a combination of a year, state, survey question, and percent of individuals who are positively identified for that question, along with stratification. Data_Value contains the corresponding value collected for each survey question. The categories for stratification are Age Range, Education, Gender, Income, Race/Ethnicity, and Total. This dataset includes observations for the years 2011-2023. Percentages and data are not included for groups with insufficient sample sizes.\n\nThe main columns of interest for our research question are:\n\n-   YearStart and YearEnd: The year the data was collected. These are the same for every row.\n-   LocationAbbr and LocationDesc: Contains the abbreviation for the data where the data was collected.\n-   Topic: Contains the topic the variable being measured falls into. For our research question, we are interested in the topic \"Physical Activity - Behavior\"\n-   Question: What is being measured. Within \"Physical Activity - Behavior\" there are 5 questions:\n    -   Percent of adults who achieve at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity and engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week\n    -   Percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity\n    -   Percent of adults who achieve at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or an equivalent combination)\n    -   Percent of adults who engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week\n    -   Percent of adults who achieve at least 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or an equivalent combination)\n-   Data_Value: The value being measured by the survey, in this case for these specific questions it will be a percentage.\n-   StratificationCategory1: What variable the data is being stratified by. Depending on the value in this column, it will contain a value in the columns \"Race\", \"Age (years)\", \"Income\", etc. For our research question we are interested in the levels in Income, such as 'Less than \\$15,000', '\\$35,000 - \\$49,999', etc.\n-   Income: Contains the income level.\n\n::: {#00476436 .cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>YearStart</th>\n      <th>YearEnd</th>\n      <th>LocationAbbr</th>\n      <th>LocationDesc</th>\n      <th>Datasource</th>\n      <th>Class</th>\n      <th>Topic</th>\n      <th>Question</th>\n      <th>Data_Value_Unit</th>\n      <th>Data_Value_Type</th>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <th>GeoLocation</th>\n      <th>ClassID</th>\n      <th>TopicID</th>\n      <th>QuestionID</th>\n      <th>DataValueTypeID</th>\n      <th>LocationID</th>\n      <th>StratificationCategory1</th>\n      <th>Stratification1</th>\n      <th>StratificationCategoryId1</th>\n      <th>StratificationID1</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>2011</td>\n      <td>2011</td>\n      <td>AK</td>\n      <td>Alaska</td>\n      <td>BRFSS</td>\n      <td>Obesity / Weight Status</td>\n      <td>Obesity / Weight Status</td>\n      <td>Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who ...</td>\n      <td>2011.0</td>\n      <td>Value</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>(64.845079957001, -147.722059036)</td>\n      <td>OWS</td>\n      <td>OWS1</td>\n      <td>Q036</td>\n      <td>VALUE</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Race/Ethnicity</td>\n      <td>2 or more races</td>\n      <td>RACE</td>\n      <td>RACE2PLUS</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2011</td>\n      <td>2011</td>\n      <td>AK</td>\n      <td>Alaska</td>\n      <td>BRFSS</td>\n      <td>Obesity / Weight Status</td>\n      <td>Obesity / Weight Status</td>\n      <td>Percent of adults aged 18 years and older who ...</td>\n      <td>2011.0</td>\n      <td>Value</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>(64.845079957001, -147.722059036)</td>\n      <td>OWS</td>\n      <td>OWS1</td>\n      <td>Q036</td>\n      <td>VALUE</td>\n      <td>2</td>\n      <td>Race/Ethnicity</td>\n      <td>Other</td>\n      <td>RACE</td>\n      <td>RACEOTH</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2011</td>\n      <td>2011</td>\n      <td>AK</td>\n      <td>Alaska</td>\n      <td>BRFSS</td>\n      <td>Physical Activity</td>\n      <td>Physical Activity -

We are only interested in the rows containing questions related to physical activity. Specifically, we are interested in the rows corresponding to the value in column `Question` that describes: \"Percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity\". There were five measurements collected related to physical activity from the phone surveys from which the dataset was derived, though not all of these questions were asked every year. The following statements are how the measurements were described in the `Question` column, but were not the way the questions were presented to participants over the phone. The exact wording of the questions is available on the [Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System website](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/questionnaires/index.htm).\n\n1.  Percent of adults who engage in no leisure-time physical activity\n\n2.  Percent of adults who achieve at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or an equivalent combination)\n\n3.  Percent of adults who engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week\n\n4.  Percent of adults who achieve at least 300 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or an equivalent combination)\n\n5.  Percent of adults who achieve at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity and engage in muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week\n\nThere are multiple columns containing the categories for stratification, such as education levels in the column `Education`. To answer our research question, we are most interested in the `Income` column. The data can also be separated by US state using the `LocationAbbr` (state abbreviation, i.e. \"AZ\") or `LocationDesc` (full state text, i.e. \"Arizona\") columns. There are also national measurements, using the abbreviation \"US\" or full text \"National\".\n\nSome of the columns contained missing values. Missing values were dropped for the column `Data_Value` because the percentage values in this column were the focus of our analysis, and we were not interested in the years where this question was not measured. One abnormality of note in this dataset was the column `Data_Value_Unit`. This column was described as containing the unit of measurement for `Data_Value`, but this was not the case as the column contained years followed by a period. This may be indicative of a data entry error.\n\n::: {#59845cad .cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>YearStart</th>\n      <th>YearEnd</th>\n      <th>LocationAbbr</th>\n      <th>LocationDesc</th>\n      <th>Datasource</th>\n      <th>Class</th>\n      <th>Topic</th>\n      <th>Question</th>\n      <th>Data_Value_Unit</th>\n      <th>Data_Value_Type</th>\n      <th>...</th>\n      <th>GeoLocation</th>\n      <th>ClassID</th>\n      <th>TopicID</th>\n      <th>QuestionID</th>\n      <th>DataValueTypeID</th>\n      <th>LocationID</th>\n      <th>StratificationCategory1</th>\n      <th>Stratification1</th>\n      <th>StratificationCategoryId1</th>\n      <th>StratificationID1</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>0 rows Ã— 33 columns</p>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {#ac7f23a2 .cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nIndex: 13930 entries, 13 to 104269\nData columns (total 26 columns):\n #   Column                      Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------                      --------------  -----  \n 0   YearStart                   13930 non-null  int64  \n 1   LocationAbbr                13930 non-null  object \n 2   LocationDesc                13930 non-null  object \n 3   Datasource                  13930 non-null  object \n 4   Class                       13930 non-null  object \n 5   Topic                       13930 non-null  object \n 6   Question                    13930 non-null  object \n 7   Data_Value_Unit             11620 non-null  float64\n 8   Data_Value_Type             13930 non-null  object \n 9   Data_Value                  13775 non-null  float64\n 10  Data_Value_Alt              13775 non-null  float64\n 11  Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol  155 non-null    object \n 12  Data_Value_Footnote         155 non-null    object \n 13  Low_Confidence_Limit        13775 non-null  float64\n 14  High_Confidence_Limit       13775 non-null  float64\n 15  Sample_Size                 13775 non-null  float64\n 16  Income                      13930 non-null  object \n 17  ClassID                     13930 non-null  object \n 18  TopicID                     13930 non-null  object \n 19  QuestionID                  13930 non-null  object \n 20  DataValueTypeID             13930 non-null  object \n 21  LocationID                  13930 non-null  int64  \n 22  StratificationCategory1     13930 non-null  object \n 23  Stratification1             13930 non-null  object \n 24  StratificationCategoryId1   13930 non-null  object \n 25  StratificationID1           13930 non-null  object \ndtypes: float64(6), int64(2), object(18)\nmemory usage: 2.9+ MB\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Encoding income as a numeric value\n\nThe income level of the participants is encoded in the dataset as a string value. The income levels were placed into the following bins:\n\n-   Less than \\$15,000\n\n-   \\$15,000 - \\$24,999\n\n-   \\$25,000 - \\$34,999\n\n-   \\$35,000 - \\$49,999\n\n-   \\$50,000 - \\$74,999\n\n-   \\$75,000 or greater\n\nThis can be used as a nominal ordinal variable, but to do linear regression this must be converted to a numeric variable. For this project, we encoded the income as the first number in the range, such as 15,000 for \\$15,000 - \\$24,999.\n\n\n\n## Visualization of Dataset\n\n### Overview of National Levels of Leisure-Time Physical Activity\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#a7091783 .cell execution_count=9}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-10-output-1.png){width=665 height=583}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis violin plot shows the distribution and density of the data for each income group, with the y-axis representing the percentage of adults not engaging in physical activity and the x-axis denoting income categories. The lowest income category, \"Less than \\$15,000\", has the highest percentage of adults who do not engage in any leisure-time physical activity, and the opposite is true for the highest income category, \"\\$75,000 or greater\", which has the most adults who do engage in leisure-time physical activity.\n\nThis plot provides a general overview of the trends in the physical activity of American adults as related to income. Further analysis of this dataset shows the same association between higher income and higher percentages of adults who engage in physical activity.\n\n::: {#33b013f1 .cell execution_count=10}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-11-output-1.png){width=1445 height=587}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd while we were focusing on leisure-time physical activity, we did want to assess whether that disparity carried through the other questions about exercise. This facet grid helps compare the disparities between income groups for all exercise categories. On the far left you can see that there is a large disparity between the lowest and highest income bracket when it comes to no leisure time physical activity. However, that gap starts to shrink as we get to different types of exercise.\n\nIt is important to note that the only question in the survey that explicitly asked participants to only consider non-job related physical activity is the question about non-leisure time physical activity, which may be one reason the disparity begins to shrink so drastically in other exercise categories.\n\n::: {#b6d5fc04 .cell execution_count=11}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-12-output-1.png){width=602 height=453}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis scatter plot shows the percent of the sample population who does not engage in leisure time activity on the Y-axis graphed with their income. On the X-axis the income is encoded as the minimum income in the range. As a numeric value, so it can be used as a numeric variable for linear regression. The linear regression line shows a downward trend with percent engaging in no leisure time, activity being associated with lower incomes. The R squared value of 0 point 7 shows a moderately strong correlation between the percent and income.\n\n# Results\n\nAccording to our analysis the lowest income bracket population had the highest percentage of people who engaged in no leisure-time physical activity. The disparity between the lowest and highest income bracket populations was around 25 percentage points. The regression analysis demonstrates a strong correlation between income and the percent of a population who engage in no leisure-time physical activity.\n\nThat disparity starts to shrink as we get to different types of exercise, but a gap of about 10 percentage points exists in most other exercise categories.\n\n# Discussion\n\nOur work, supports the hypothesis we have that people with higher incomes have generally more time to engage in exercise in their free time. While the percent of those not engaging in physical activity has increased in the past 10 years, the lowest income brackets continue to have the largest percentage of their population who engage in no leisure-time physical activity.\n\nWhile the disparity in other exercises categories was less than for no leisure-time physical activity, it is important to note that the only question in the survey that explicitly asked participants to only consider non-job related physical activity is the question about non-leisure time physical activity, which may be one reason the disparity begins to shrink so drastically in other exercise categories.\n\nTo further investigate the disparities in physical activity. Using this data set, we could further break down the data by other demographics, such as age, ethnicity, education, and location in future work. With this data set, it would also be insightful to address some of the problems with this data, such as certain questions being missing for certain years and insufficient sample sizes for some rows in the data set.\n\n",
