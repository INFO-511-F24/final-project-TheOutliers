## Introduction

Understanding the relationship between socioeconomic status and health behaviors is necessary for addressing disparities in public health outcomes. Our project seeks to understand whether higher-income populations consistently have more time for physical activity than lower income populations using a dataset from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The dataset is specifically from the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity (DNPAO) and was derived from phone surveys conducted between 2011 and 2023. The whole dataset offers insights into physical activity, nutrition, and obesity trends among U.S. residents aged 18 and older. For the purpose of this project, we are focusing on the survey questions related to physical activity. The data is stratified by factors such as age, education, gender, income, and race/ethnicity.

Our team's research question asks whether individuals with lower income levels have less leisure time for physical activity, and we hypothesize that this is true. This type of investigation is important for identifying specific groups that may face structural barriers to adopting healthy lifestyles, and therefore impacting public health interventions that can benefit those groups. We hope to gain a broader understanding of health inequities with this analysis.

## Abstract

### Analysis plan

Initial detailed exploration of the data (focusing on the main variables involved) will be followed by data cleaning and some wrangling. Identification of missing observations, data type conversions, etc. will be addressed in these initial steps. The variables involved to answer the largest research question include the "Question" and "Income" and "StratificationCategoryId1" columns, as well as the "Data_Value" column and the "YearStart" column. New columns that group some of these variables may also be created, such as grouping the "Income" values into "Low Income" and "High Income". At this point there is no plan to bring in and merge any external data.

Once the data has been wrangled, it can be visualized in an assortment of plots for analysis, and summary statistics by group can be compiled as well. These visualizations and statistics will allow for insight as to how the relationship between income and physical activity compares between groups, as well as over time. From here, additional metrics can be run, plots created, etc. to explore and dive in further.
