## Abstract

### Analysis plan

Initial detailed exploration of the data (focusing on the main variables involved) will be followed by data cleaning and some wrangling. Identification of missing observations, data type conversions, etc. will be addressed in these initial steps. The variables involved to answer the largest research question include the "Question" and "Income" and "StratificationCategoryId1" columns, as well as the "Data_Value" column and the "YearStart" column. New columns that group some of these variables may also be created, such as grouping the "Income" values into "Low Income" and "High Income". At this point there is no plan to bring in and merge any external data.

Once the data has been wrangled, it can be visualized in an assortment of plots for analysis, and summary statistics by group can be compiled as well. These visualizations and statistics will allow for insight as to how the relationship between income and physical activity compares between groups, as well as over time. From here, additional metrics can be run, plots created, etc. to explore and dive in further.
